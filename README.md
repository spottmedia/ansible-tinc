# Introduction

Ansible playbook used at https://codengine.io to configure tinc mesh VPN network , tested on Debian 9, Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 16.04

This sets up a tinc VPN between several servers. It also adds /etc/hosts entries for the inventory hostnames to resolve to the VPN IP addresses.

## Prerequisites

Your local machine (where Ansible is installed) must be able to log in to the remote servers as "root", preferably with passwordless public SSH key, which is specified as the `remote_user` in `/ansible.cfg`.

By default, this playbook will bind tinc to the IP address on the `eth1` interface (private network interface on DigitalOcean Droplets). See the "Review Group Variables" section to change this.

## Preparation

### Create Inventory

Create a `/hosts` file with the nodes that you want to include in the VPN:

```
[vpn]
prod01 vpn_ip=10.0.0.1 ansible_host=162.243.125.98
prod02 vpn_ip=10.0.0.2 ansible_host=162.243.243.235
prod03 vpn_ip=10.0.0.3 ansible_host=162.243.249.86
prod04 vpn_ip=10.0.0.4 ansible_host=162.243.252.151

```

The first line, `[vpn]`, specifies that the host entries directly below it are part of the "vpn" group. Members of this group will have the Tinc mesh VPN configured on them.

- The first column is where you set the inventory name of a host, "node01" in the first line of the example, how Ansible will refer to the host. This value is used to configure Tinc connections, and to generate `/etc/hosts` entries. Do not use hyphens here, as Tinc does not support them in host names
- `vpn_ip` is the IP address that the node will use for the VPN
- `ansible_host` must be set to a value that your ansible machine can reach the node at

**Note:** The inventory hostname, which we are using as each node's name in Tinc, can't contain characters that Tinc doesn't allow for node names. For example, hyphens (`-`) are not allowed.

### Review Group Variables

The `/roles/tinc/vars/main.yml` file contains a few values that you may want to modify.

- `physical_ip` specifies which IP address you want tinc to bind to, based on network interface name. It is set to `eth1` (ansible_eth1) by default. On DigitalOcean, `eth1` is the private network interface so *Private Networking* must be enabled unless you would rather use the public network interface (`eth0`)
- `vpn_interface` specifies the tinc netname and vpn network interface. It's set to `vpn0` by default.
- `vpn_netmask` specifies the netmask that the will be applied to the VPN interface. By default, it's set to `255.255.255.0`, which means that each `vpn_ip` is a Class C address which can only communicate with other hosts within the same subnet. For example, a `10.0.0.x` will not be able to communicate with a `10.0.1.x` host unless the subnet is enlarged by changing `vpn_netmask` to something like `255.255.0.0`.

## Set Up Tinc

Run the playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml
```

After the playbook completes, all of the hosts in the inventory file should be able to communicate with each other over the VPN network.

## Quick Test

Log in to your first host and ping the second host:

```bash
ping 10.0.0.2
```

Or, assuming one of your hosts is named `prod02`, run this:

```bash
ping prod02
```

Feel free to test the other nodes.

## How to Add new Servers

All servers listed in the the `[vpn]` group in the `/hosts` file will be part of the VPN. To add new VPN members, simply add the new servers to the `[vpn]` group then re-run the Playbook:

```command
ansible-playbook site.yml
```
